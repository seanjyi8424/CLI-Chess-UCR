## Project Description
  * The reason why we chose Chess is because of its timeless value and popularity. Till this very day Chess continues to thrive and evolve despite starting in the 16th century. 
  * We plan on implementing the visitor design pattern since we will be performing various operations on similar objects like chess pieces, games, etc.
  * The program will prompt the user to input commands such as move, undo, new game, and quit. The output will be a chessboard using characters to signify squares and borders for the x and y axis. The output should also print the pieces in the correct locations.
  * The project will be created using C++ using source-code editing tools like VSCode and XCode depending on the author.
  * Once all of the intended features are implemented our chess game is expected to differentiate legal from illegal moves, allow players to undo moves, and load unfinished games.

 > ## Final deliverable
 > All group members will give a demo to the TA/reader during lab time. The TA/reader will check the demo and the project GitHub repository and ask a few questions to all the team members. 
 > Before the demo, you should do the following:
 > * Complete the sections below (i.e. Screenshots, Installation/Usage, Testing)
 > * Plan one more sprint (that you will not necessarily complete before the end of the quarter). Your In-progress and In-testing columns should be empty (you are not doing more work currently) but your TODO column should have a full sprint plan in it as you have done before. This should include any known bugs (there should be some) or new features you would like to add. These should appear as issues/cards on your Project board.
 > * Make sure your README file and Project board are up-to-date reflecting the current status of your project (e.g. any changes that you have made during the project such as changes to your class diagram). Previous versions should still be visible through your commit history. 
 
 ## Screenshots
 > Screenshots of the input/output after running your application
 ## Installation/Usage
 > Instructions on installing and running your application
 ## Testing
 > How was your project tested/validated? If you used CI, you should have a "build passing" badge in this README.
